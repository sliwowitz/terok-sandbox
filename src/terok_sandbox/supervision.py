"""Post-start supervision check — did the per-container supervisor come up?

A container start deliberately *survives* a broken supervisor: the OCI
hook soft-fails so a spawn failure never blocks the container, and
terok-shield's egress firewall is fail-closed on its own hook.  What must
not happen is that the degradation stays **silent** — a container whose
vault-routed providers and git gate are all dead, behaving normally at the
shell, with nothing said (issue #458).

[`verify_supervision`][terok_sandbox.supervision.verify_supervision] closes
that gap on the API launch path.  After the container starts, it reads the
same sidecar the supervisor reads, and — when the sidecar declares
socket-mode services — polls briefly for the sockets the supervisor binds.
On timeout it returns a [`SupervisionStatus`][terok_sandbox.supervision.SupervisionStatus]
naming the container, the unbound socket(s), and the hook diary to read;
the caller shouts it but the launch still succeeds (soft-fail preserved),
and an orchestrator may escalate on the structured result.

Both transports are covered.  Socket-mode wiring binds sockets under
``/run/terok``; TCP-mode wiring binds per-container loopback ports, and
``/proc/net/tcp`` says which ports are listening — one read answers for
every service at once, and it contacts none of them (an accept-and-close
probe on each start would put a stray connection in three service logs to
learn what a file already says).  The pure-Python file poll never runs a
subprocess and never raises.

Every service the sidecar wires is checked, the SSH signer included.  A
dead signer costs the task its git access, and it is the child most likely
to die alone: it and the vault are the only two that must open the
credential store, so a passphrase the supervisor cannot resolve takes out
exactly those two and leaves the rest of the bundle looking healthy.

[`outdated_container_warning`][terok_sandbox.supervision.outdated_container_warning]
closes the mirror-image gap.  A container's environment is frozen when it is
created.  A container that outlives a change to the ``/run/terok`` layout
therefore keeps naming sockets this sandbox no longer binds.  The supervisor is
healthy and the bridges start; they connect to nothing.  The symptom arrives
half a minute later as an empty reply, not as a refused connection.  The check
reads the container's protocol stamp and reports the gap.  It never enforces —
an operator can keep using the parts of the container that still work, and
recreate it when that suits them.
